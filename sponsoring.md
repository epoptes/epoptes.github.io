# Sponsoring

<a href="https://ts.sch.gr"><img src="/ts.png" alt="ts" width="80" height="60" align="right"></a>Epoptes development is currently sponsored by [Greek Government Public Investments Program](http://www.ggea.gr) run by the [Computer Technology Institute and Press DIOPHANTUS](https://www.cti.gr/en) and assigned to the [Greek Schools Technical Support team](https://ts.sch.gr).

A lot of Epoptes improvements landed during a [Google Summer of Code 2023 project](https://github.com/epoptes/epoptes/pull/204), and the Python3/Gtk3 rewrite was part of a [GSoC 2018 project](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-epoptes/wiki).

During 2011 - 2015 it was sponsored by [NSRF 2007 - 2013 Program](http://2007-2013.espa.gr/en/Pages/staticWhatIsESPA.aspx) run by the [Computer Technology Institute and Press DIOPHANTUS](https://www.cti.gr/en) under the [Hellenic School Technical Support Action](https://ts.sch.gr/) of [Stirizo Project](https://www.cti.gr/en/activities-en/development-projects-en/item/63-stirizw/63-stirizw).

In 2009, as part of a project called [sch-scripts](https://sch-scripts.gitlab.io), Epoptes [received funding](https://old.ellak.gr/index658a.html?option=com_openwiki&Itemid=103&id=ellak:sch-scripts) from [GFOSS](https://gfoss.eu).
