# Translations

To [translate Epoptes in your language](https://translations.launchpad.net/epoptes) you only need a web browser and a launchpad account. Usually less than half an hour is needed to complete the process. Once you've finished your translation, it will be automatically included in the next epoptes version.

Please note that currently there's no native english speaker in Epoptes development team, so if you see some english text that contains syntax or grammatical errors or could be expressed in a more appropriate way, don't hesitate to contact the developers about it.

Extensive help for translators is available [in this page](https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/StartingToTranslate).
