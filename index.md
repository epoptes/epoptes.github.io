# About

Epoptes ([Επόπτης](epoptes.mp3) - a Greek word for overseer) is an [open source](https://gplv3.fsf.org) computer lab management and monitoring tool. It allows for screen broadcasting and monitoring, remote command execution, message sending, imposing restrictions like screen locking or sound muting the clients and much more!

It can be installed in [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/epoptes), [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/epoptes), [RPM](https://github.com/epoptes/epoptes/releases) and [ArchLinux](https://aur.archlinux.org/pkgbase/epoptes-client) based computer labs that may contain any combination of the following: [LTSP](https://ltsp.org) servers, thin and fat clients, non LTSP servers, standalone workstations, [FreeRDP](https://www.freerdp.com/) or [X2Go](https://wiki.x2go.org) clients etc. Patches for other distros are welcome.

Epoptes has been translated into more than [40 languages](https://translations.launchpad.net/epoptes) and it's being used in many installations all around the world. It's considered mature and periodically new features are added like the recent Python3 / Gtk3 support. It's maintained by IT teachers that use it in their classrooms, so it should be around for a long time!
